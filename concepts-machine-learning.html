<h2>Concepts: Machine Learning</h2>
<p>##What is it about
Machine Learning is a field that draws on computer science, statistics, and mathematics with the aim of replicating what passes as human learning in specific application domains, such as pattern recognition. In an overly simplifying way we could say that ML is linear algebra + probability theory + statistics + computing.  It has spawn off from Artificial Intelligence, when the latter went on in its effort to replicate human intelligence, while Machine Learning focused on solving specific domain problems and relied more heavily on statistics and probability. The digitalisation of greater amounts of information and the cheaper computing power gave ML, a wider field of application, along the material and the capabilities to build models. The ability to replicate specific domain application prompted ML to be adopted in industry in many fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-does-it-fit-in-data-science">
<h2>Where does it fit in Data Science</h2>
<p>Machine Learning lies at the core of any data application. It provides the machinery for transforming data into insights. We do not mean to say that it is the single most important part of the pipeline; we have seen that with bad data you cannot get good results. And in many situations even understanding the data, and using traditional statistical tool is already a long way. Yet it is the workhorse of any project; if it works right one can get often impressive results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-details">
<h2>The details</h2>
<p>In a high level of abstraction we could say that Machine Learning is a form of inductive reasoning, as it also the case with statistics.  In broad terms the objective is to draw inferences: If A then B - the machinery might be diverse but the logic is the same.
We construct a model that we believe describes/replicates the real world processed
We feed the model with data and estimate the parameters of the model
Then, we bring new data to the estimated model, and make inferences about the qualities of the new data</p>
<p>Let us now see how this generic description takes a specific form, in the case of Machine Learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-problem-representation">
<h2>The problem representation</h2>
<p>Most learning problems start with a mathematical representation of the task, along which comes an function that measures the errors the model makes. In the case of linear regression we have a straight line/plane that goes through the data and the error function measures how far our line/plane is from all the data points. In the case of classification/decision trees we have there are branches that represent decision the model makes at each node, while there are different error functions that measure, in a classification setting, how well the model classifies data in the categories created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="from-representation-to-optimisation">
<h2>From representation to optimisation</h2>
<p>Once we have a way to represent the problem and have defined a way to measure the success or failure through an error function, the next step follows naturally. We try to minimise the error; this is the fundamental way we have te represent learning. In the context of classification trees, that means create the final classes with as few mis-classifications as possible. In this way we make the transition to mathematical optimisation; given a function that represents the problem, choose the parameters so that the function when fed with the data will produce the smallest possible error.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-about-other-possible-data">
<h2>What about other possible data?</h2>
<p>Beware! We have minimised the error for the data we had; what will happen when new, unseen data, will be fed to the model? The new data will not exactly match what we used in the first place, so the error will be different. An important idea here is the bias - variance trade-off. Suppose we can make our model too complex so that it will mimic really close the initial data - that is achieve low bias. But when new data will come in, the error we will get will vary a lot - that is there will be high variance. The alternative is to have a simple model that will not capture the initial data really good - there will be high bias. Yet, when new data come in, the error will not vary too much - the variance will be relatively low. The important lesson here is that we cannot minimise both bias and variance at the same time. We have to find just about the right balance between the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="so-how-do-we-assess-our-model">
<h2>So, how do we assess our model?</h2>
<p>When we train a model we can compute the error that the model makes with the data that it was trained. We need a way to estimate the error when new data will be fed to the model and gauge how well the model will behave in the future. There different techniques for doing so, but all depend on the same idea: use the data at hand to simulate the unseen data.
One common approach is to split the data into a training set, and a holdout set. In the case of cross-validation, the training set is further split into many random training and test sets. We repeatedly train our model on one set and test it on the other set. This iterative process help us find the model parameter that most probably will produce the lowest possible error with a new data set. Once we are done with the cross-validation, we use the holdout set verify that our results hold even with a new set that has not been used at all.</p>
