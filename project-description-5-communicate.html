<div class="section" id="what-this-section-is-about">
<h2>What this section is about</h2>
<p>This is the exit point for our project, and hopefully a successful one. Te be more precise, this might not be end of the project altogether. Even if we put together the ‘final report’, it is final with respect our involvement. The report will be used by the stakeholders to give insight to their actions. It might also be the case that the project lives one as production code for an application. In any case, it’s not that we are done and we don’t have any responsibility any longer. Others will use our work and the quality of it will make a difference.</p>
<p>Until now, we have seen, somehow, a single iteration: from initial question, to various data transformations, to modelling. We are not done in the first try; each pass over this cycle gives us some insight, and we repeat until we get the results we want – or give up... In any case with every iteration it would b good to prepare even a rudimentary set of documents that belong to the final stage.</p>
<p>The main objective here, is to gather the knowledge/insights we have found out, present them in a comprehensive, yet clear manner, and help whoever is going to use our report/product to see the choices we have made and the reasons for doing so. In this way they will be able to understand the strengths and limitations of our work, and it should be easier to make changes in the future.</p>
<p>If we have been careful to produce a detailed documentation along the way, then we should have most of the pieces necessary for our report; from the domain knowledge and the initial questions, to the detailed data description, to the modelling report.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="input">
<h2>input</h2>
<p>For this section the input is all the pieces that have been
produced up to this point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="processes">
<h2>processes</h2>
<p>Revisit the various stages and compile the project report. Then, both the executive summary and the presentation can be put together.
As for the code base, if the scripts for each stage have been correctly produced, then it should not be any difficult to put everything together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>output</h2>
<p>The desired output for this section is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The project report. This is the main description for the whole project. As we’ve  said, it should comprehensive and clear. It should make obvious the choices made and the pieces of knowledge attained.</li>
<li>The executive summary. This is a shorter version of the project report. This is not because executives are stupid; it is rather that their role is to make decisions. Therefore the executive summary focuses more on clarifying possible courses of action.</li>
<li>The project presentation. As it is usually the case, there is a final presentation to be used in meetings with the stakeholders.</li>
<li>The code base. Even if the project is not handed over to the engineering team for deployment, it is still necessary to produce a clean code base to be handed over. One reason is reproducibility. As with any research activity, ideally, others should be able to independently verify our results. The stakeholders should be sure that we have not just threw some fancy code snippets and visualisations. The other reason is the ability to revisit and extend the project in the future. Maybe a new dataset has been made available. It would be a waste to have to write all the code from the beginning.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>example</h2>

<div class="section" id="attention">
<h2>attention</h2>
<p>If we have to pay attention to a couple of points these would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The narrative is important. One cannot simply throw the technical material on a PDF file and get done. There are many reasons for that. For example, different audiences have different experiences and competences; it can’t be one size fits all. The very nature of a data science project is that of putting many different parts together, and the connections and motivations for these connections, are not always immediately visible.</li>
<li>The project structure. It is worth repeating that if the project structure is good, both code and reports are well documented, the decisions made with explicit thinking, etc., then it will be easier, not only to get through with the project, but also to communicate it.</li>
<li>Visualisation is really useful. It is a cliché to say that a picture is worth thousands words, but in many cases a good visual representation of our work can get us a long way, both in analytical terms and communication.</li>
<li>Reproducibility matters. It is suffice to mention the case when two well known economists writing on a hotly debated matter, failed to demonstrate how they arrived at their conclusions; a fact that damaged the validity of their argument, and possibly their reputation too. (See the case of a 2010 economics paper <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_a_Time_of_Debt">Growth in a Time of Debt</a> )</li>
