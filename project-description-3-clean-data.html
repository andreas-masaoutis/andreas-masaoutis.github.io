<h2>What this section is about</h2>
<p>After having decided about the data we should collect and store, in this stage we start to prepare the data for the subsequent analysis. There two important goals here. First, to avoid what goes by the acronym GIGO; that is ‘Garbage In, Garbage Out’. It is obvious that if the values that we use are not correct, then either the analysis will not produce results, or even worse, will produce statistically valid results, but that will fail to materialise in reality. Second, to get a deeper idea about the variables in the dataset, and their interrelations. Therefore, what we have here are three main goals, where each one of them informs the others. As it was the case in stage 1, here too we have a triangle where each vertex is cleaning, validating, and summarising our data.  Let us see in more detail.</p>
<p>In the previous stage, we tried to make sure that the data we have conform to some rules. If, for example, we loaded records in a database, we wanted to make sure that each column has the correct type. Here we can take a step further. If a field goes under the name ‘patient height’ we should have already made sure that each record is a float number – measuring in meters. Suppose we observe the value 18.5m. In that case it is almost sure that the decimal sign is misplaced by one digit, and we should correct this value. Another example is a misspelled string, say a company name, which would then appear as a separate entity, although it’s not. This should be fixed too. This is the sort of activity that I use the term cleaning for.</p>
<p>If we do all that - we will be more explicit in the next level - we will have a caught many data glitches, input errors, etc. But we will still need something more; we will have to compare our data, against the domain canvas. This is necessary since we cannot interpret data otherwise. Revisiting the airdata example, suppose we have a flight record with normal fields. The departure time is before the arrival time, the dates are ok, etc. We perform a calculation to find the speed of the flight (distance over airtime), and surprisingly it is higher than 1 Mach. Is this possible for a domestic passenger flight? Well, in order to clarify the issue we need to get further than looking at the data set and delve into the specific domain. Only in this way we can validate that what is there in our dataset, corresponds to the real processes that produced it.</p>
<p>As you have probably noticed, we have already made use of summary statistics. In detecting the abnormal ‘patient height’ we didn’t check every individual record, but looked at the range of the values which showed the abnormal maximum. That is, summarising the main characteristics of the dataset, is not something to be done in the end. It is part of iterative process. Actually, we could even start with producing summary statistics and plots for the data. This first look will help us to detect possible anomalies to be further examined, that will lead to a better understanding, that will lead to better summary statistics, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="input">
<h2>input</h2>
<p>At this stage the input is the main data source we have prepared previously. Note, that the domain knowledge collected in stage 1, will also be useful in make sense of the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="processing-steps">
<h2>processing steps</h2>
<p>First effort to describe data - summary statistics, lots of plots.
Flag possible errors and outliers
Perform semantic tests against the domain canvas
Decide what should be &quot;flagged&quot;. Removing records might not be good practice, flag them as inappropriate instead.
Produce summary statistics and plots. If more problems spring out, repeat the above processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>output</h2>
<p>After having performed the above steps, we should be having these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Review of decisions on data cleaning: outliers, input errors, etc.</li>
<li>Data description report.</li>
<li>The cleaned data set; a transformed copy of the &quot;read only&quot; raw data.</li>
<li>The code script for that section, that should be reading the data, fixing what is to be fixed, and producing the necessary plots and summary statistics tables to be used in the data description report.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>example</h2>
<p>We continue with the airdata example we introduced in the previous articles. In the previous stage we have decided on the way to store the data relevant for answering the questions at hand.</p>
<p>It is now time to start exploring the dataset. How many airports and airlines are there? The variable descriptions of the <a class="reference external" href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html">flights data</a> indicate that departure and arrival times are recorded in local time. Do these make sense? Are these in accordance with the flight duration captured in other variables? Do different air carriers have variations in the delays? In the next section we will see some of our findings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attention">
<h2>attention</h2>
<p>If we have to pay attention to a couple of points these would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Instead of removing records, flag them and leave them with the rest of the data if it is possible. You might remove something that shouldn’t have been removed. Also, the ‘bad’ themselves might have certain patterns worth investigating.</li>
<li>Use a lot of plots. Visual inspection can provide more information, faster.</li>
<li>Don’t forget the domain. You need it to understand what is normal and what is not.</li>
