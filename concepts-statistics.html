<h2>Statistics: inferences from data</h2>
<p>As a brief introduction we will try to define what statistics is, and to clarify the relations between statistics and adjacent fields like mathematics and machine learning.</p>
<p>Statistics has a main goal and that is to extract meaning from data. Moore uses a definition that refers to the distinct steps of statistics project: 'Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, and interpreting numerical facts, which we call data'.</p>
<p>Let us start with what data is. It is not just numbers or labels; one does not have data without the context. A list of numbers is a list of numbers without the knowledge of their meaning. Without the context we do not know if the numbers make sense or not and we cannot be sure whether we are allowed to use statistical techniques.</p>
<p>Since we deal a lot with numbers, mathematics do have an important role; it provides the theory at a level of abstraction characteristic of mathematics. For example, a binomial distribution behaves the same for all random processes that have a binary result; and that is great to know. From the moment we move away from the abstraction towards the real world, we need to make all sort of decisions and use our intuition. That is, we move beyond mathematics, into statistics.</p>
<p>As statistics is an applied field it grew out the practical problems of science and industry. The form statistics has assumed in the 20th century can be in great part explained by these needs. Think of quality control for a moment. It is imperative to work with a sample, since we cannot simply try every single barrel of whiskey to verify its quality, and find a way to draw inferences from the sample so that their validity extends to the whole population/production.</p>
<p>Out the practice grew the three main areas in statistics when working with data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The collection of it</li>
<li>The organisation of it</li>
<li>The drawing of inferences from it</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us see each part in more detail</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sampling-the-standard-way-to-collect-data">
<h2>Sampling: the standard way to collect data</h2>
<p>In sampling we do not simply gather data. We try to make sure, as much as possible, that the data we gather are representative of the whole population. Without this precondition no amount of technical sophistication will produce correct results. If, for example, measure people's height outside of a basketball court, we will not get a representative sample of the population. and subsequently fail to estimating the height of the population.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="describe">
<h2>describe</h2>
<p>Once we have our sample, the next thing to do is to use descriptive statistics in order to summarise the data and describe its main features. This is also called exploratory data analysis. It is our effort to a first systematic look at the data. We start first by looking at each variable we have and try to verify that it conforms to the its standard. We go on looking at the possible relationships among the variables. In doing so, we use a lot of plots, but also numerical summaries of the data.
That's where some of the mathematical concepts of the probability distributions, and their characteristics, the mean and standard deviation, concepts like correlation, enter the picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="infer">
<h2>infer</h2>
<p>The third stage, after having a sample and an initial picture of the data, is drawing inferences. The usual process is to formulate a hypothesis - say that the true mean of the population is zero, compute the relevant statistic from the sample - in that case the sample mean, and then using the theory, try to infer whether the population mean is indeed zero or not. That's the fundamental concept in statistics: compute a fact about the sample, and try to guess the truth about the population.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-computer">
<h2>using the computer</h2>
<p>In the past inferential statistics rested heavily on theoretical notions. With the computer we have developed computational techniques to draw inferences while relaxing the assumptions necessary for the theory to work. We will make a comparison between classical inference and the bootstrap method in order to demonstrate the difference.</p>
<p>A central concept in statistics is the sampling distribution. Imagine a population that has a characteristic, say average height. If we draw a random sample from the population, this sample will have an average height, that might or might not be close to the population average height. If, thought, we take many samples from the population and write down the average height for each sample, then these average heights follow a distribution of their own, with a mean, close to the true mean of the whole population. This is the sampling distribution and usually it follows the normal distribution. The sampling distribution is fundamental for taking the next step, to relate the sample to the population.</p>
<p>In traditional statistics, we do not know what the true population mean is, and we cannot draw many samples. We only have one. Then we rely on the theory, the central limit theorem, to assume the form of a hypothetical sampling distribution, that we will then use for the practice of inference.</p>
<p>There are certain cases though, that the theory will not work. In these cases we are left with only a sample. The computer then comes to the rescue. In order to approximate the sampling distribution we repeatedly draw samples with replacement, from our initial sample. It turns out that the distribution of the bootstrapped samples can be used for inference.</p>
<p>This is an example of how computation can substitute for theory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statistics-in-data-science">
<h2>statistics in data science</h2>
<p>In data science we make use of statistics; directly using ideas in exploratory analysis and the whole machinery of probability distributions and other concepts, and indirectly as a basis for statistical learning - a big part of Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Machine Learning is different compared to statistics:
1- Data are not carefully produced, therefore, many of the techniques developed in traditional statistics do not work
2 - With the computer we can manipulate the data in other ways apart from those that fit into a mathematical context.</p>
<p>That does not mean statistics is irrelevant to Data Science; on the contrary the lessons learnt in the former can be really helpful with the latter. Think for a moment a situation that does happen with data analysis. In the presence of a big data set we might want to work on a smaller part. If we are not careful enough to draw a random sample, then we will not find interesting patterns that are indeed in the whole data set, and we might 'find' pattern in our sample that are simply non existent in the data set. Using a statistically savvy mindset, can protect from a lot of traps waiting for the unwary data analyst</p>
