<h2>What this section is about</h2>
<p>This is the heart of any project that works with data. It is where the question will meet the data, resulting in a conclusion. It is the most, technically, complicated and difficult part, and the same time the most rewarding, if you get it right. It is where statistics, and linear algebra, and computer science, meet in the field of Machine Learning. For the time being we will provide a simple description, enough so that the methodology makes sense.</p>
<p>In the previous stage we created a clean dataset, and got a deeper understanding of the variables and their relations. We also have an initial question/objective. The way to connect these two ends goes through a series of steps that pass through four layers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First of all we have our question/domain problem. We revisit the start-up that wants to build an application that can predict whether a flight will be delayed.</li>
<li>This problem translates, in the language of Machine Learning, to a problem of classification. Given an observation, a certain flight with all its characteristics, we should assign it to a class along with other delayed flights or to the class with the on-time flights.</li>
<li>There many different techniques to classify, each with its own characteristics. We can choose a decision tree for their easy and generality.</li>
<li>Once we have chosen a general modelling technique we have to decide on the specific algorithm that will be used to implement the said technique. In the case of decision trees that could be CART</li>
</ul>
<p>Deciding on the modelling technique and the specific algorithm depends heavily on the properties and the characteristics of our data. Certain algorithms do not handle well categorical, while others do better. Some struggle with with noisy data while others do not. These observations brings us to the important lesson in Machine Learning that no algorithm and model is always better than the rest. Every time there is the right tool for the job. This lesson comes under the name, “There is no free lunch”</p>
<p>Once we have decided on the algorithm to be used, it is time to revisit our data. They are clean but not yet ready. First of all we should create new features that might be relevant for our model. In the case of the airdata, if we want to include the age of the aircraft as an explanatory variable, we will first have to compute it. Second, we should bring the variables in the right format. For example, certain algorithms need that numeric variables are standardised, otherwise variables with larger numbers in absolute terms tend to dominate, and thus invalidate, the results. If it is possible it to would be great to save separately the specific dataset with the new features, so that model and the particular data version go hand in hand.</p>
<p>After the relevant features are created, it is time to estimate our model. This is the process of feeding the algorithm with the data, so that the former learns, in this case how to classify, each observation. The tricky part, is that each modelling technique and each algorithm, come with many parameters that control the behaviour of the model. It can be a fairly complicated matter, to get the parameters right. We will cover certain methods in the next sections.</p>
<p>Our model is now trained, and it has ‘learned’ to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not using, in the case of decision trees, certain rules. Still, we are not there yet. We do not know whether this model is any good or not. It has its accuracy and other metrics but we cannot know how it will behave if we try to use the rules of this model to predict new observations, not seen before. In order to estimate the behaviour of the model in the future, we use a portion of data that has not been used before; the test data. It is on this dataset that we calculate certain metrics, hoping that these will produce an accurate estimation of the model behaviour in the future, with completely new data.</p>

<h2>input</h2>
<p>At this stage the input is the clean dataset produced previously.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="processing-steps">
<h2>processing steps</h2>
<p>Start with a hypothesis, such as, by using that and that variables we can predict / explain the desired outcome.
Go through the four layers of data mining and select the modelling technique and algorithm.
Create the suitable features for this technique according to the initial hypothesis.
Split the data in training and test sections
Choose the parameters and train the model using the training data
Assess it using the test data</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>output</h2>
<p>The desired output for this section is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The modelling report. It is the main document that describes all the choices and results.</li>
<li>A copy of the data set to use for the model</li>
<li>A copy of the trained model</li>
<li>The code script for this section</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>example</h2>
<p>We continue with the airdata example we introduced in the previous articles. In the previous section we produced a clean dataset and the report on it. The initial question we had was about the delays and whether we could predict them.</p>
<p>The dataset contains a series of variables that could be used as is. Note that there are many different categories of delays. See for example <a class="reference external" href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html">variable 29</a> that captures the delay due to an aircraft being in delay. That variable could be the basis for a small model about this specific kind of delay. If, in addition, the data exploration has demonstrated that older planes tend to have more delays, we could construct a categorical, or maybe binary, value in order to capture this feature: whether a flight uses an old plane or not. We should also take a look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/posters/">presentations</a> of the other participants in the competition, and search for other possibly useful features. Then we should decide on the modelling technique and the specific algorithm. Once we have that, we create the final dataset, with the relevant features in the correct form, and proceed with training and estimating the model. Hopefully, we will have a good prediction and classification at least about this kind of delays.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attention">
<h2>attention</h2>
<p>If we have to pay attention to a couple of points these would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There is no best modelling technique and algorithm. Each is best for certain situations and before choosing among alternatives one should have a good understanding of both the problem at hand and the alternatives.</li>
<li>Beware of data snooping. The saying that “if you torture your data long enough, it will confess” provides us with a hint. It is not difficult to train models that perform well on the training data if you try all conceivable alternatives. These models will not necessarily perform well on completely new data.</li>
